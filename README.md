## Background

Ceptor Club is a community of artists, gamers, and techies building open-source software, games, and art. 
We recognize as we grow, we need to establish a governance structure that is transparent, decentralized, and community-driven.
We are all volunteers, and must pass a rite of passage to become a member of the club. It is simple, modeled after the TTRPG that we love.  A first hero's quest, doing good for Ceptor Club, completing a First Mission or joining us to submit a project in a hackathon. 

**our mission:** make ttrpg easier, faster and more fun for everyone.
